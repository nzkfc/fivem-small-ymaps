# fivem-small-ymaps

These are small ymaps that fixes things in the map or adds to it, simply stream out the ymap from your resources folder as required. 
You can group them in one folder or seperate them, just remember to use a fxmanifest.lua file for them.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**pdm_construction.ymap** - Adds a construction scene wrapped around the default PDM location (compatible with https://github.com/Bob74/bob74_ipl as well) Handy if you use another PDM and want to stop people going into that location or similar.

**fbiroofatirum.ymap** - Adds all glass panels to the top of the FIB building and adds a helipad to the top. (FYI bob74_ipl already has the glass fix if you don't want the helicopter pad)

**meth.ymap** - A few tiny edits of CCTV, barrels and such which I used for the original qb-core meth location, sometimes being in the city too much is boring so made a wee spot for it.

**PrisonEdit.ymap** - Adds a few objects outside like gym equipment, soccor field with a ball and some more fences to keep prisoners in closer, I aslo added fences to the western side of the buildings where there were gaps.
